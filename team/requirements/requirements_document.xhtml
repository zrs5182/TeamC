<h2>Status of This Document</h2>
<p>
This draft is under review by Truman State University: CS 370: Team C, for use by Truman State University for the purpose of increasing the critical thinking abilities of students through the use of argument mapping. This document is subject to change at any time, and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted at any time.

<p>
This document defines the high-level requirements for the Argument Mapping Software being designed for Truman State University. The requirements are categorized as follows:
